# Secure User Interfaces

## Abstract

As critical human activities are increasingly being conducted online such as personal and commercial communications, transmission of funds, voting, providing legally-binding digital signatures, and so on, the importance of designing interfaces that are both user-friendly and secure is growing.

Using a social messaging interface as a use case, we focus on the need to co-design user experience and underlying security foundations.

<!-- This paper has three parts. -->

<!-- First we will define criteria of a secure communication system including technical feasibility, ethical desirability and usability.  -->

<!-- We will then explore the requirements of a user interface that conveys the security of the system to users in an intuitive way, with an emphasis on inclusive design.  -->

<!-- We will conclude by issuing recommended design patterns and principles illustrated via best practices for decentralized applications. -->

<!-- ## Requirements -->
## User flows by comparison

### Composing a private message
### Composing public vs private messages
### Onboarding new users
### Viewing profile
### Searching for users
### Adding connections
### Contact management
### Receiving message

<!-- Petnames, edge names, proposed names -->

<!-- Phishing attack -->

## Design patterns and principles
### Original design principles
### New principles
